# diffusion2D

## Project description
This package provides a solution for the 2D diffusion equation over a square domain using the Finite Difference Method. The domain starts at a uniform temperature, with a circular disc at the center at a higher temperature. Users can modify thermal diffusivity and initial conditions to simulate various scenarios. The output includes four plots showing the diffusion process at different timepoints.

## Installing the package
### Using pip3 to install from PyPI
To install the package, use:
```bash
pip3 install diffusion2D
```

### Required dependencies
- Python (>=3.6)
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Running this package
To run the simulation, execute the following command:
```bash
diffusion2D
```
Ensure you have configured the parameters such as thermal diffusivity and initial conditions.
